With Kivy, you can create apps that run on:
1. Desktop computers: macOS, Linux, Windows.
2. iOS devices: iPad, iPhone.
3. Android devices: tablets, phones.
4. Any other touch-enabled professional/homebrew devices supporting TUIO

One of the best ways to learn a new skill is by creating something useful. With that in mind, I use Kivy to build a calculator that supports the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
