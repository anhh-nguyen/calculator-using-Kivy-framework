# calculator-using-Kivy-framework
With Kivy, you can create apps that run on:
1. Desktop computers: macOS, Linux, Windows.
2. iOS devices: iPad, iPhone.
3. Android devices: tablets, phones.
4. Any other touch-enabled professional/homebrew devices supporting TUIO

One of the best ways to learn a new skill is by creating something useful. With that in mind, I use Kivy to build a calculator that supports the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

#Build

1. Install necessary dependencies
```
python -m pip install kivy
python install Pillow
python -m pip install pygame
```

2. Build
```
python3 app.py
```
